{% block overview %}
<p> This was a fun project. The school district I worked for had over $300,000
    of Chromebooks that were unaccounted for. This was mostly due to poor asset
    management and the use of Google Sheets as a way to manage device assignments. 
    That just doesn't work for 3,000+ students and staff especially when the district
    averages about 1,000 repair tickets a year for those devices. Once the software 
    and its use were implemented, there were zero devices that were unaccounted for 
    at the end of the school year.
</p>
<p>
    My solution was to create a custom tailored desktop application and set up a virtual 
    server to run the backend. The first
    iteration was pretty bare bones but it allowed us to assign devices to students
    or staff and quickly assign a loaner or a totally new device if repairs were
    needed. I started with a script to import all active Active Directory users daily 
    into a SQL Server Express instance. The database was not large and there were not many 
    concurrent users so the load was low. This provided an extremely cost effective 
    solution to the district. I used the ldap3 and pandas libraries to accomplish 
    the import. A simple star schema was used in the database.
</p>
<p>
    The second iteration is where I had a lot of fun. I used the Google Workspace SDK
    to pull a list of the district devices. I then used SQLalchemy to build some models
    and manipulate the tables. This allowed automation of importing and keeping good
    data in the device table. I also implemented a feature to set a flag for devices 
    in need of repair. This allowed our IT department to quickly add notes and keep 
    student and staff abreast of repair status.

<p>
    My biggest challenge was creating a way to allow users to set their database and 
    allow for different types of logins and database software. I wanted this to be 
    available to other districts who did not have a good way of managing their devices.
    This meant I must set up a configuration file to build out the database with tables
    if they were not present but not overwrite any data or cause an error. I accomplished
    this by creating models with SQLalchemy. I built out logic and allowed users to save
    configuration settings so IT departments could set up the software and set inital 
    configuration but end users just had to login. If they used SQL Server Windows Auth
    was an option since most districts are using AD.
</p>
<p>
    The next challenge was keeping an updated count of device assignments and repairs.
    This was not necessary but something I thought was just cool. The problem was if 
    the function was called to update those, all other processes stopped. I had to use 
    multithreading to accomplish this. 
<p>
    My last major challenge was disabling the app or allowing to keep the connection
    to the server alive if the server connection was close to timing out. In the first iteration I noticed users were leaving the app
    open and receiving errors. An obvious connection timeout was overlooked in my testing.
    I set a function to run every few minutes to check connection to the server. Once
    again multithreading came in handy here.
</p>
<p>
    I prefer web applications but this was an interesting project and I believe
    I learned more from this project than any other becuase I had to build out more
    functionality on my own.
